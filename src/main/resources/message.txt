Hi %s,
Famous American scientists have proven that work-life balance is damn necessary to keep you job satisfaction high. Just to name a few advantages from taking a break:
You have more time to fight with your family and friends :family:
You can waste entire days on useless activities, not only afternoons and evenings :hourglass:
You could spend more time on your side project that is going to trash anyway :put_litter_in_its_place:
Life and reality are more tolerable when you are well rested :zzz:
You could also travel a world and see something cool or smth :globe_with_meridians:
I have spied in Calamari that you've got plenty of days off to take, do you need any more arguments to enjoy your holiday?
You deserve it! <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVRnMrl2oj8|Chill out like a BOSS> :cool-doge:
Peace :peace-out:
